The final implementations of the two algorithms can be found under the `Milestone4` folder. `Algorithm1.py` and `Algorithm2.py` contain the code for the first and second algorithm, respectively.

To run either of the two algorithms:
1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine and navigate to the Milestone4 directory using the command line or terminal.
2. It is important to run the commands from the Milestone4 directory for file path reasons. Do not run `python Milestone4/Algorithm1.py` or `python Milestone4/Algorithm2.py` as this may result in file path errors.
3. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your machine. If not, please install it before proceeding.
4. To execute Algorithm1.py, run the command `python Algorithm1.py` in the terminal or command prompt.
5. To execute Algorithm2.py, run the command `python Algorithm2.py` in the terminal or command prompt.

6. After executing either algorithm, a directory called "TransformedDataset" will be created by the programs. This directory should contain all transformed files from the dataset. This verifies that the algorithm has worked correctly.
